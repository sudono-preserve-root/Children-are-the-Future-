    <p class="text-lg mb-4">Children Are The Future (CATF) was founded with the belief that access to education, nutrition, and opportunity should not be determined by geography. Our mission is to empower young people in Nigeria with the tools they need to succeed and thrive through comprehensive support—educational, physical, and emotional.</p>
    <p class="text-lg">We focus on providing books, clothing, food, hygiene resources, and educational support to create environments where children can flourish.</p>
